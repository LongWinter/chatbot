This is a food ordering chat bot system that we created on Local Hack Day 2018 @ U of M(yes, we did it in 1 day)

###
We trained our NLP(natural language processing) model with Microsoft LUIS.ai.
Our NLP model is trained over menu items from Kiwa Korean Restaurant and designed to be able to take orders for that restaurant.

###
Only three intentions are predefined given limited time and lack of menu item dataset local in Winnipeg.
- OrderFood: user wants to order food
- QueryOnMenu: user wnats to check menu
- Confirmed: user wants to place order
Our NLP model takes user input, analyzes it, and send back user's intention along with food they want to order, size of food and etc...

###
This repository only contains our simple backend script and some of the ordering logic 

Please feel free to contact us if you are interest!
